      <p class="p p-jd">At Precious Plastic we communicate with our audience primarily through our <a href="#" class="videolink green">website</a> and <a href="#" class="videolink green">forum</a>. Our people come to the website to learn how to work with plastic waste and go to the forum to get further help from the community. Our website was accessed 1,5 million times since launch in March 2017 and our forum counts over 37k active members. We owe our dedicated audience the best possible digital experience to boost plastic recycling worldwide. Lots of fun and challenges ahead of you, friend developer ðŸš€ .
        <br>
        <br>Our main priority is to improve our digital platforms and facilitate local collaboration between our people. First, we want to create a map, along the lines of <a href="http://themakermap.com/" class="videolink green" target="_blank">this one</a>- which happens to be open source ðŸ˜Ž . This should make your work faster, however, we would need to customise a few elements for our platform.
        <br>We also need occasional help with maintenance on both our website and forum. This usually accounts for a few hours a month.
        <br>
        <br>We are looking for dedicated developers, programmers, hackers, students that can join our cause to fight plastic pollution and help us maintain a top class digital experience for our audience. You'll be working on:
        <br>
        <br>- Tweak and develop a map to connect our community
        <br>- Maintain and update our website &amp; forum
        <br>- Develop version 3 of our website (near future)</p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">Skills</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd">We are looking for someone fully dedicate to solve global problems affecting humanity with their programming skills. Your creativity, passion and talent will help push Precious Plastic closer to a solution to the plastic waste problem. The right candidate should be able to work with our existing framework, available on <a href="https://github.com/hakkens/precious-plastic" class="videolink green" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>Generally the candidate would have the followings:
        <br>- web development skills (wordpress, html &amp; css, Javascript, Jekyll, php)
        <br>- an absolute focus for details
        <br>- self driven approach
        <br>
        <br>Near terms tasks:
        <br>- develop the map
        <br>- fix minor problems on website and forum
        <br>
        <br>Future development:
        <br>- develop and launch version 3 of our website
        <br>- develop an e-commerce
        <br>
        <br>Nice to have:
        <br>- passion for open source
        <br>- familiar with 3D</p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">Where?</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd">This position is remote.
        <br>Day &amp; night on slack and skype, yes it is ðŸŽ‰</p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">When?</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd">Developing the map is crucial to a successful scaling of the project,&nbsp;ideally we would start working on this as soon as possible. Other maintenance tasks are minor and can be tackled at later stage. The development of the new website will only happen in a few months.</p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">Feel like coding for us?</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd">You can send us an email with samples of your work at:

      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">Not familiar with Precious Plastic yet?</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd"><a class="videolink green" href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/" target="_blank">Precious Plastic</a> is an open source project aiming at boosting plastic recycling worldwide by empowering local communities and individuals with tools and knowledge to extract new value from plastic waste.
        <br>
        <br>We have developed four open source machines to enable people to start recycling plastic and create new financial value from an ubiquitous free resource, plastic waste. The machines are specifically developed using universal materials and basic tools that are available all over the world. A modular design allows users to adapt the machines to their specific contexts.
        <br>
        <br>All our material is available online for free. Blueprints, technical drawings, detailed instruction videos and the download-kit are all shared open source online. This is all the basic information people need to build their own machines and start a little plastic factory, anywhere in the world.
