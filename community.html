      <p class="p p-jd"><a class="videolink violet" href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/" target="_blank">Precious Plastic</a> is an open source project aiming at boosting plastic recycling worldwide by empowering local communities and individuals with tools and knowledge to extract new value from plastic waste.
        <br>
        <br>We have developed four open source machines to enable people to start recycling plastic and create new financial value from an ubiquitous free resource, plastic waste. The machines are specifically developed using universal materials and basic tools that are available all over the world. A modular design allows users to adapt the machines to their specific contexts.
        <br>
        <br>All our material is available online for free. Blueprints, technical drawings, detailed instruction videos and the download-kit are all shared open source online. This is all the basic information people need to build their own machines and start a little plastic factory, anywhere in the world.
