      <h1 class="h2 h2-support">What we offer</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-support">At Precious Plastic we believe in the power of people, not money. We work with super talented & dedicated people that are with us to fight plastic pollution. Together.
        <br>
        <br>We manage to bring Version 2 to life with very <b>(SUPER)</b> limited budget and managed to come this far. We work with limited resources and think that those budget constrains have been crucial to bring about the necessary innovation.
        <br>
        <br>We are not sure how this campaign will go, however, all money raised will go 100% into the project. Which means we will also try to cover as much expenses as we can for the people involved.
        <br>
        <br>Besides that, you get the unique opportunity to contribute your talent to find solutions to one of the biggest problem facing humankind. You will work with like minded people, learn about a new technology that will, most likely, become relevant in the future as plastic pollution skyrockets and get <a class="link-support light-green" href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/thanks" target="_blank">credits</a> on our website.
        <br>
        <br>We know what we offer is not usual, but you could have the unique opportunity to play a key role to fight plastic pollution and help people across the world.

      <p class="paragraph-support"><a class="link-support light-green" href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/" target="_blank">Precious Plastic</a>&nbsp;is an open source project aiming at boosting plastic recycling worldwide by empowering local communities and individuals with tools and knowledge to extract new value from plastic waste.
        <br>
        <br>We have developed four open source machines to enable people to start recycling plastic and create new financial value from an ubiquitous free resource, plastic waste. The machines are specifically developed using universal materials and basic tools that are available all over the world. A modular design allows users to adapt the machines to their specific contexts.
        <br>
        <br>All our material is available online for free. Blueprints, technical drawings, detailed instruction videos and the download-kit are all shared open source online. This is all the basic information people need to build their own machines and start a little plastic factory, anywhere in the world.
