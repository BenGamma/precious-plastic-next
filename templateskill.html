      <p class="p p-jd">Precious Plastic is now at a stage where <a href="http://lab.preciousplastic.com/" class="videolink lightblue" target="_blank">a lot of people</a> around the world have built the machines but are still struggling to find appropriate ways to work with them. For the moment, most people are reproducing the few objects we have originally made- which we intended to be an inspiration rather than the end goal. This is slowing the scaling of the project. We understand this as our own design fault and are ready to fix it. âœŠ
        <br>
        <br>You will be working closely with the Precious Plastic team to research &amp; develop a number&nbsp;of valuable applications, creations, objects or products that can be easily reproduced globally from our people using our machines. The process will be recorded and documented to be shared with the community.
        <br>
        <br>We are looking for a dedicated product designer, artist, maker, wood worker, student and generally someone hands on that can help us scale the global impact of Precious Plastic. You'll be working on:
        <br>
        <br>- Experimenting with Precious Plastic machines &amp; plastic
        <br>- Creating new products or applications
        <br>- Develop new moulds for our machines
        <br>- Discover new inventive and effective ways of operating our machines&nbsp;
        <br>- Further research on different types of plastics and their relationship with the machines</p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">Skills</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd">We are looking for someone fully dedicate to solve global problems affecting humanity.
        <br>Your creativity, talent and enthusiasm will help push Precious Plastic closer to a solution to the plastic waste problem. For the product designer role we're searching for self-driven individuals keen on pushing the boundaries of plastic recycling as a craft, with or without our machines.
        <br>
        <br>Generally the candidate would have the followings:
        <br>- an absolute focus for details
        <br>- self driven approach
        <br>- aesthetic sense
        <br>- able to work in a workshop with standard machinery (metal saw, table saw, welder, grinder, drill etc). We're open for new approaches and techniques but you'll be most likely working with metal
        <br>- ready to fail repeatedly&nbsp;
        <br>- work independently
        <br>- background in design, art, sculpture, wood or metal
        <br>
        <br>Nice to have:
        <br>- 3D modelling skills
        <br>- welding skills
        <br>- previous experience working with plastic
        <br>- some experience working with metal
        <br>- good understanding of materials and their properties</p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">Where?</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd">For this position we need you on location at our workshop near Eindhoven. It's a nice, spacious and bright workspace with all the tools, machines, types of plastics and needed resources to conduct the research.</p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">When?</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd">Plastic pollution is raging the world daily, not waiting for us. An "army" of machines is ready to start solving this problem but missing some final help from us. We would need someone to start as soon as possible for a duration of, at least, 4 weeks.</p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">Want to design with us?</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd">You can send us an email with samples of your works and one suggestion for a product you would design with Precious Plastic machines at:
        <br><a href="mailto:hello@preciousplastic.com" class="videolink lightblue">hello@preciousplastic.com<br> </a>
      </p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">Not familiar with Precious Plastic yet?</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd"><a class="videolink lightblue" href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/" target="_blank">Precious Plastic</a> is an open source project aiming at boosting plastic recycling worldwide by empowering local communities and individuals with tools and knowledge to extract new value from plastic waste.
        <br>
        <br>We have developed four open source machines to enable people to start recycling plastic and create new financial value from an ubiquitous free resource, plastic waste. The machines are specifically developed using universal materials and basic tools that are available all over the world. A modular design allows users to adapt the machines to their specific contexts.
        <br>
        <br>All our material is available online for free. Blueprints, technical drawings, detailed instruction videos and the download-kit are all shared open source online. This is all the basic information people need to build their own machines and start a little plastic factory, anywhere in the world.
