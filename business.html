      <p class="paragraph-support">Precious Plastic has developed 4 machines to recycle plastic and puts them online for free (yes, for free ðŸ˜€ ) so people all around the world can reproduce them and start recycling plastic. People can make objects, products and raw material. We want to help our people make a better living while recycling plastic around the world. For this to happen they need business guidance.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>You will be working creating an open source business plan to be shared online for free for everyone to benefit from. This would need to be created with developing realities in mind where extreme poverty and plastic pollution is the norm.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>We are also in the process of transforming Precious Plastic into a social business and might need some counselling along the way. Our bottom line is, and always will be, to recycle as much plastic as possible but we need to become financially independent.&nbsp;You'll be working on:
        <br>
        <br>- Creating a business model for people that built our machines
        <br>- Advise Precious Plastic on its own business model
        <br>

      <p class="paragraph-support"><a class="link-support orange" href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/" target="_blank">Precious Plastic</a>&nbsp;is an open source project aiming at boosting plastic recycling worldwide by empowering local communities and individuals with tools and knowledge to extract new value from plastic waste.
        <br>
        <br>We have developed four open source machines to enable people to start recycling plastic and create new financial value from an ubiquitous free resource, plastic waste. The machines are specifically developed using universal materials and basic tools that are available all over the world. A modular design allows users to adapt the machines to their specific contexts.
        <br>
        <br>All our material is available online for free. Blueprints, technical drawings, detailed instruction videos and the download-kit are all shared open source online. This is all the basic information people need to build their own machines and start a little plastic factory, anywhere in the world.
