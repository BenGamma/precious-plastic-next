      <p class="paragraph-support">Precious Plastic has developed 4 machines to recycle plastic and puts them online for free (yes, for free üòÄ ) so people all around the world can reproduce them and start recycling plastic. People can make objects, products and raw material. We want to help our people make a better living while recycling plastic around the world. For this to happen they need business guidance.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>You will be working creating an open source business plan to be shared online for free for everyone to benefit from. This would need to be created with developing realities in mind where extreme poverty and plastic pollution is the norm.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>We are also in the process of transforming Precious Plastic into a social business and might need some counselling along the way. Our bottom line is, and always will be, to recycle as much plastic as possible but we need to become financially independent.&nbsp;You'll be working on:
        <br>
        <br>- Creating a business model for people that built our machines
        <br>- Advise Precious Plastic on its own business model
        <br>
        <br>Have a look at our&nbsp;<a href="plan.html" class="link-support orange" target="_blank">full plan</a>&nbsp;for more details.</p>
      <h1 class="h2 h2-support">Ready for the challenge?</h1>

        <br>- self driven approach
        <br>- work with limited resources

      <p class="paragraph-support">
        <a class="link-support light-green" href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/" target="_blank"></a>This position will be remote.</p>
      <h1 class="h2 h2-support">When</h1>

        <h1 class="h2 h2-support">What we offer</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-support">At Precious Plastic we believe in the power of people, not money. We work with super talented & dedicated people that are with us to fight plastic pollution. Together.
          <br>
          <br>We manage to bring Version 2 to life with very <b>(SUPER)</b> limited budget and managed to come this far. We work with limited resources and think that those budget constrains have been crucial to bring about the necessary innovation.
          <br>
          <br>We are not sure how this campaign will go, however, all money raised will go 100% into the project. Which means we will also try to cover as much expenses as we can for the people involved.
          <br>
          <br>Besides that, you get the unique opportunity to contribute your talent to find solutions to one of the biggest problem facing humankind. You will work with like minded people, learn about a new technology that will, most likely, become relevant in the future as plastic pollution skyrockets and get <a class="link-support orange" href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/thanks" target="_blank">credits</a> on our website.
          <br>
          <br>We know what we offer is not usual, but you could have the unique opportunity to play a key role to fight plastic pollution and help people across the world.

      <p class="paragraph-support"><a class="link-support orange" href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/" target="_blank">Precious Plastic</a>&nbsp;is an open source project aiming at boosting plastic recycling worldwide by empowering local communities and individuals with tools and knowledge to extract new value from plastic waste.
        <br>
        <br>We have developed four open source machines to enable people to start recycling plastic and create new financial value from an ubiquitous free resource, plastic waste. The machines are specifically developed using universal materials and basic tools that are available all over the world. A modular design allows users to adapt the machines to their specific contexts.
        <br>
        <br>All our material is available online for free. Blueprints, technical drawings, detailed instruction videos and the download-kit are all shared open source online. This is all the basic information people need to build their own machines and start a little plastic factory, anywhere in the world.
