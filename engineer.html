      <p class="p p-jd">Precious Plastic is built upon our four open source machines- shredder, extruder, injection and compression. We share them online and teach people how to reproduce them so people can start recycle plastic locally. The better the machines, the more people will get started and the more plastic waste will be cleaned up. Engineers have one of the most exciting and important roles at Precious Plastic.
        <br>
        <br>Machines from the current version work good but, as you might imagine, there are multiple ways to improve them. Efficiency, cost, safety and energy efficiency amongst others could all be improved.
        <br>
        <br>We are also flirting with the idea of developing a fifth machine to include in version 3- a sheet press. Anyone with experience or know-how should come forward. We would also like to research more on moulds and how to get the most out of our machines to speed up the scaling of the project.
        <br>
        <br>We are looking for dedicated a engineer, student or intern to take on this role for the next few months. To recap you'll be working on:
        <br>
        <br>- Improving the existing machines
        <br>- Creating new moulds
        <br>- Possibly develop sheet press machine</p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">Skills</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd">We are looking for someone fully dedicate to solve global problems affecting humanity.
        <br>Your skills and work will help push Precious Plastic closer to a solution to the plastic waste problem and benefit people all around the world . We are looking for skilled hands-on engineers. We work with basic tools avoiding advanced techniques so it is easier to replicate the machines all over the world.
        <br>
        <br>Generally the candidate would have the followings:
        <br>- problem solving mindset
        <br>- work with low-end / basic tooling
        <br>- self driven approach
        <br>- inventive
        <br>- ready to fail repeatedly&nbsp;
        <br>- work independently
        <br>- keen on optimising the machines
        <br>
        <br>Nice to have:
        <br>- 3D modelling skills (currently using Autodesk Fusion)
        <br>- previous experience working with plastic
        <br>- good understanding of materials and their properties
        <br>- able to engineer with developing countries in mind</p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">Where?</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd">For this position we would need you on location at our workshop near Eindhoven. It's a nice, spacious and bright workspace with all the tools, machines, types of plastics and needed resources to conduct the research.</p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">When?</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd">Plastic pollution is raging the world, and not waiting for us.
        <br>The sooner you can start the better.</p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">Want to change the world?</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd">You can send us an email with samples of your works and a suggestion for an improvement on our machines at:
        <br><a href="mailto:hello@preciousplastic.com" class="videolink yellow">hello@preciousplastic.com<br> </a>
      </p>
      <h2 class="h2 h2-skill">Not familiar with Precious Plastic yet?</h2>
      <p class="p p-jd"><a class="videolink yellow" href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/" target="_blank">Precious Plastic</a> is an open source project aiming at boosting plastic recycling worldwide by empowering local communities and individuals with tools and knowledge to extract new value from plastic waste.
        <br>
        <br>We have developed four open source machines to enable people to start recycling plastic and create new financial value from an ubiquitous free resource, plastic waste. The machines are specifically developed using universal materials and basic tools that are available all over the world. A modular design allows users to adapt the machines to their specific contexts.
        <br>
        <br>All our material is available online for free. Blueprints, technical drawings, detailed instruction videos and the download-kit are all shared open source online. This is all the basic information people need to build their own machines and start a little plastic factory, anywhere in the world.
