      <p class="paragraph-support">This is probably the most fun and accessible way to help Precious Plastic. Everyone can get involved with this, in their free time in the evening or while bored at work üòá . &nbsp;
        <br>We are trying to multiply our efforts to win awards and prices that will fund Precious Plastic search for a solution to plastic waste. There is a multitude of potential prices out there waiting for Precious Plastic to be won.
        <br>
        <br>People often tells us we should submit to this or that award. But for as much as we would love to do it, our team is too tiny to search the entire web for open calls or submissions- we simply have to priorities our tasks. That's why we decided to experiment with this a bit and open this process to our people, to you üëá !
        <br>
        <br>And you know what's the sweetest thing?&nbsp;
        <br>You get&nbsp;<span class="_5">5%</span>&nbsp;cash reward in case Precious Plastic wins the price.
        <br>For example, if thanks to your application Precious Plastic wins 20.000$ you will receive 1000$. Pretty sweet, hey?</p>
      <h1 class="h2 h2-support">How it works</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-support">This is how we envision this working:
        <br>1.&nbsp;You find an award or price.
        <br>2. You make sure no one else in the community has submitted it already here.&nbsp;
        <br>2.&nbsp;You fill in the application to your best abilities.
        <br>3.&nbsp;You submit the application.
        <br>4.&nbsp;You write name + award in this post
        <br>5.&nbsp;We hope for the best ‚úåÔ∏è
        <br>
        <br>We have created a topic on our forum where everyone interested to participate can find useful information, possible awards, tips and help on how and where to submit. Here it is also where you can check for submitted awards (<strong>don't double submit</strong>).
        <br>
        <br>We have created a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ltaiyCoFNPIyRldhJv2tgDZxj7wj5sH6P1M7vmS91o/edit" class="link-support purple" target="_blank">googleDoc</a>&nbsp;with a, somehow, detailed description of the project and its achievements so far. You can copy, edit, improve and use this content in the application process.
        <br>
        <br>You can download hi-res images of the machines and products from&nbsp;<a href="#" class="link-support purple">here</a>.
        <br>
        <br>We trust our community, so you can use your credentials (email and password) to submit the application. Then let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="#" class="link-support purple">forum</a>&nbsp;and cross your finger for the results.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br><strong>*Please don't submit paid applications.</strong>
        <br><strong>**We will only pay the 5% reward to the first person that submits the award and tells us.</strong>

      <h1 class="h2 h2-support">Where</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-support">
        <a class="link-support light-green" href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/" target="_blank"></a>From your couch, in the metro, at your university or workshop we don't mind- it's your call. Let's make it happen üèÜ</p>
      <h1 class="h2 h2-support">Not familiar with Precious Plastic yet?</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-support"><a class="link-support purple" href="https://preciousplastic.com/en/" target="_blank">Precious Plastic</a>&nbsp;is an open source project aiming at boosting plastic recycling worldwide by empowering local communities and individuals with tools and knowledge to extract new value from plastic waste.
        <br>
        <br>We have developed four open source machines to enable people to start recycling plastic and create new financial value from an ubiquitous free resource, plastic waste. The machines are specifically developed using universal materials and basic tools that are available all over the world. A modular design allows users to adapt the machines to their specific contexts.
        <br>
        <br>All our material is available online for free. Blueprints, technical drawings, detailed instruction videos and the download-kit are all shared open source online. This is all the basic information people need to build their own machines and start a little plastic factory, anywhere in the world.
